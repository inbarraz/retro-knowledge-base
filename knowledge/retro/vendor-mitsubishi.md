## Platform-Specific Knowledge

### AT-13332A Monitor

#### Overview
- OEM basis for IBM PCjr monitor - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Manufactured October 1985 in Japan - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- 13" color CRT with greenish-blue phosphor characteristic of Mitsubishi tubes - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- CGA digital TTL monitor (5V or 0V signals, not analog RGB) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Painted case (no yellowing) with darker gray and lighter beige-gray colors - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Physical Differences from IBM PCjr Monitor
- Side ventilation vs top ventilation on PCjr version (side keeps dust out better) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- No speaker (PCjr version has speaker and larger bezel) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- H-center control on front (PCjr version has volume control instead) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Standard DE-9 connector (PCjr version has proprietary connector carrying audio) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Built-in non-detachable grounded power cable (Japanese version likely had IEC connector) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Japanese domestic version likely had EIAJ multi-pin RGB connector (plastic block installed instead for export) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Connectors
- DE-9 connector with all pins populated - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Connector has screws - must be screwed in fully for proper contact - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### External Controls (Hidden Door on Front)
- Horizontal center - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Contrast - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Brightness - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Controls are downward-facing potentiometers accessed by flipping down hidden door - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Internal Controls (PCB)
- V-center: Multi-position (3 or 4 position) switch - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- H-center: Additional internal control besides front panel - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Horizontal size (width coil): Requires plastic adjustment tool, not metal - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- V-height and V-hold: Accessible through rear holes (unlabeled from outside) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Vertical linearity: Located on bottom, visible through neck board - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- For PAL/50Hz operation, V-height and V-hold may need adjustment - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Flyback Controls
- Focus control - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Screen control (adjusts raster brightness baseline) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Neck Board Design
- All video processing happens on neck board for highest picture quality - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Main PCB handles only deflection and power supply - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Opto-couplers isolate digital inputs from DE-9 connector to protect from sparks/damage - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Drive controls and bias controls along top edge of neck board - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Sub-brightness control on neck board (front brightness control feeds to it) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Service mode switch: Draws single horizontal line for proper drive/cut adjustment - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### CRT Details
- Mitsubishi-made color picture tube - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Model number sticker on tube matches monitor (AT-13332A L) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Corner correction magnets on deflection yoke edges for geometry and purity control - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Shows care in manufacturing for good geometry - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Common Faults
- Hygroscopic glue on yoke: Absorbs water, becomes conductive, can corrode enamel-coated copper windings on deflection yoke - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- High voltage anode cable: Becomes brittle/crispy with age, "like a piece of plastic now" - should not be manipulated or may crumble - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Worn CRT symptoms: Very dim picture, blooming when brightness increased, weak color guns (especially red and blue weaker than green) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Red drive turned all the way up indicates worn red gun - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Overdriving worn CRT to compensate causes blooming and blown-out text - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Brown text fringing with yellow may be monitor fault or original characteristic - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Diagnostic Approaches
- First power-on test: Apply AC power with no input signal, verify high voltage and no sparks - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Listen for sounds, watch for problems before connecting video - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Watch for collapse pattern when turning off (indicates working deflection) - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- If connector not fully screwed in, may lose horizontal sync signal - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Use Jim Leonard's CGA Compatibility Suite for testing CGA monitors - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Repair Notes
- Anode cable replacement may be possible but not commonly done - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- CRT from low-hour PCjr monitor could potentially be swapped in - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]

#### Picture Quality Assessment
- Worn unit rated "C+" - usable but dim, especially in bright rooms - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Properly handles brown color (not dark yellow) which is correct for CGA - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Camera auto-gain can make dim CRTs look better in photos than in person - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
- Always test CRTs in person before buying when possible - Source: [_MljEAIpQ8g]
