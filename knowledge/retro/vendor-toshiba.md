- 24 kilovolts high voltage - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

#### Physical Design
- Faux wood grain cabinet (1970s style) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Heavy construction with solid metal internal chassis - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Metal carry handle on top - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Rod antennas for VHF/UHF (300 ohm terminals) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Interlocking power cord (disconnects when cover removed for safety) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Built-in circuit breaker for fire protection - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

#### Controls
- Push-pull knobs: Power/Volume and Contrast/ABC - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- VHF tuner (clunky mechanical knob) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- UHF tuner (83 channels, typical North American allocation) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Color PST and Tint PST internal adjustments on side - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Brightness control with sub-brightness on back - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Automatic fine tuning (AFT) switch with 3 positions: Off, On, ABC - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- ABC setting appears to brighten picture slightly - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

#### Rear Panel Adjustments
- Drive and Bias controls for CRT - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Vertical hold, Vertical linearity, Vertical size - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Sub-brightness control - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- AGC (Automatic Gain Control) adjustment - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Focus control (edge of chassis) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

#### Internal Construction
- Multiple plug-in modules on main board - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Integrated circuits on modules (advanced for 1978) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Modules held in place by metal bar - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Soot buildup inside indicates heavy use over years - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Flyback transformer under cover - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Tripler steps voltage up to 24kV for CRT - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Convergence controls on deflection yoke - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

#### Power Supply
- Pass transistor design with power resistors - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- B+ voltage approximately 135V - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Rectifies 120V AC to ~160V DC, bleeds excess through resistors - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Power resistors mounted away from other electronics - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- High line voltage can stress power supply resistors - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Gray electrolytic caps visible (may need replacement eventually) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

#### Common Issues

##### Stuck Potentiometers
- Old grease in pots turns solid over decades - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Color and tint controls commonly affected - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Brightness control can become very stiff - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- VHF tuner can be "touchy" with dirty contacts - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

##### Vertical Deflection
- May need cap replacement in vertical circuit - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Symptoms: Image stretched at top, compressed at bottom ("eggy") - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Vertical size control may need to run at maximum - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Linearity adjustment helps but can't fully compensate for old caps - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

#### Repair Notes
- No composite input - RF only - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Live chassis - cannot safely add composite mod without isolation transformer - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- SAMS schematic available for service (~$20) - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Module connections can cause intermittent issues - check for cold solder joints - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]

#### Safety
- Interlocking power cord prevents operation with cover removed - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- This was common on tube-era TVs where owners might service them - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
- Live chassis design means dangerous voltages throughout - Source: [igwRNYgOA_A]
