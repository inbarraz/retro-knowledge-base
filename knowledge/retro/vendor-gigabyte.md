## Platform-Specific Knowledge

### GA-586TX2 Socket 7 Motherboard

#### Overview
- Socket 7 motherboard for Pentium/Pentium MMX processors - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Uses Intel 430TX chipset - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Supports both AT and ATX power connectors - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Part numbers starting with "GA-" indicate Gigabyte brand - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Does not have AGP slot (PCI only for graphics) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

#### Expansion Slots
- Three ISA slots - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Four PCI slots - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- No AGP slot - AGP more common on ATX boards - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

#### Memory Support
- Supports 72-pin SIMM modules (install in pairs for 64-bit data bus) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Supports SDRAM DIMMs (PC100/PC133) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- SDRAM DIMMs are 64-bit wide, can use single module - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

#### Cache Memory
- Has cache chips on motherboard - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Real cache chips have traces going to chipset - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Fake cache chips on some boards have traces that go nowhere - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Some versions have two cache chips (higher-end variant) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

#### BIOS
- Award BIOS - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Uses CR2032 coin cell for CMOS (not NiCad) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- BIOS date visible in setup (12/9/1997 on observed board) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Database: retrocomputing.net has BIOS version info - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

#### CPU Settings
- Supports Pentium MMX 233MHz - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Pentium MMX multiplier settings are unlocked for underclocking - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Can underclock to 166MHz or lower for older game compatibility - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Cannot overclock via multiplier (can only go down) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- L1 and L2 cache can be disabled in BIOS for even slower speeds - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Disabled cache + underclocking = approximately 386-era performance - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

#### BIOS Features
- AT vs ATX power supply selection (auto or manual) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- CPU temperature protection option - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- SDRAM timing configuration - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Speculative read option - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- USB support header available - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

#### Integrated Peripherals
- Dual IDE (primary and secondary) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Floppy controller - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Two serial ports (one 25-pin, one 9-pin via brackets) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Parallel port - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- PS/2 mouse port (indicates Pentium-class - no 486 boards had this) - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- PS/2 port via slot adapter bracket - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

#### Form Factor
- Baby AT form factor - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Fits in mini-tower AT cases - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Removable tray design on some cases makes motherboard easy to remove - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]

## General Notes

### Identifying Gigabyte Motherboards
- Part numbers start with "GA-" prefix - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- May not have "Gigabyte" branding visible on board - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
- Look for GA-xxx part number printed on PCB - Source: [vh9fVhSNzGg]
