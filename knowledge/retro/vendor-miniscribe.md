## Platform-Specific Knowledge

### 3438 (5.25" MFM Hard Drive)

#### Specifications
- 5.25-inch form factor, full height - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Stepper motor actuator (standard stepper, not 90-degree like Seagate) - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Date code: July 18, 1987 - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Silver label makes model number hard to read - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

#### Common Faults

##### Stiction (Spindle Motor)
- Disc won't spin on power-up - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Bearings seize during long storage - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- May start spinning with slight physical tap/manipulation - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Once spinning, should spin up easier on subsequent power cycles - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

##### Stepper Motor Binding
- Stepper motor bearing becomes stiff/gummed up - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Drive gives flash error code (blink code) - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Head can't complete initialization seek - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Stepper should turn freely when power is off - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Energized stepper is harder to turn (coils holding position) - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

##### Blink/Flash Error Codes
- Miniscribe drives have LED error codes in Morse code format - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Zero = half second of flashing - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- One = continuous on - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Half second between bits, full second between code repeats - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Code D (1101) = Seek error during burn-in or recal - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

#### Diagnostic Approaches
- Listen for "hot electronics" smell (indicates power but not necessarily problem) - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Check if stepper motor turns freely with power off - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Look up error codes in Miniscribe manual - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Watch stepper motor during power-on to see if it completes full initialization - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

#### Repair Techniques

##### Stiction Recovery
- Physical tap may free stuck spindle - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Opening drive NOT required for stiction - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Percussive maintenance sometimes works - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

##### Stepper Motor Lubrication
- Remove metal structure covering stepper motor area - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Apply bearing oil into stepper motor shaft - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Manually rotate stepper through sticky spots while powered off - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Only manipulate heads while disc is spinning or just stopped - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Power cycle many times while manipulating stepper - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- May take 50+ power cycles to work through sticky spots - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

##### Low-Level Formatting After Recovery
- Once drive responds, must low-level format - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Format may fail at certain tracks where stepper binds - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Keep power cycling and manipulating until format completes - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Warm drive works more reliably than cold drive - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Let drive run for hours to warm up and loosen bearings - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

#### Reliability Warnings
- Lubricated bearings are temporary fix only - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Drive will fail again, especially after storage - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Cold drive (after sitting) will have problems until warmed up - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- May take 20-30 minutes of running before reliable - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Only use recovery technique if need to retrieve data from drive - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
- Not suitable for regular use - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]

#### Notes
- Miniscribe made both 3.5" and 5.25" MFM drives - Source: [CpQ2j2J6wL0]
