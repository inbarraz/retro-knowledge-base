## Platform-Specific Knowledge

### Olympic S (Олимпик С)

#### Overview
- Ukrainian ZX Spectrum clone - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Post-Soviet manufacture (example: October 1994) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- 48K RAM - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Uses Z80 CPU (real Zilog Z80 by 1994, not always clones) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]

#### Construction Quality
- Extremely primitive construction - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Used whatever parts were available (varied between units) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Panel-mount DIN jacks with flying leads (even when PCB has proper footprints) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Hand-engraved and hand-painted connector labels on back panel - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Cheap, flimsy-feeling plastic - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Pink glue used liberally on components - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Quality varied significantly between production runs - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]

#### Keyboard
- Very springy feel - double springs inside each key (inner and outer) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Keys wobbly and halfhazard alignment - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- High force required to press keys - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Some keys have crunchy feel - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Stabilizers on Enter and Space bar - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Key legends match ZX Spectrum (CAP SHIFT, SYMBOL SHIFT, etc.) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]

#### Connectors
- All ports use 5-pin DIN connectors (power, joystick, video, tape, bus) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Same connector for everything - be careful not to cross-connect! - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Expansion port may not be populated on all units - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]

#### Manual
- In Russian/Ukrainian with Cyrillic text - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- BASIC keywords in English - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Character set supports Cyrillic - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Cut-and-paste corrections common (pasted over sections) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Handwritten crossouts and annotations - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Certifications and registrations in back pages - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Type-in BASIC programs included - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]

#### Power Supply
- External transformer-based PSU (heavy) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- 220V input - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Linear regulator with heat sink (can brown plastic case) - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Chunky power switch with LED indicator - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]

## Historical Context

### ZX Spectrum Clones
- ZX Spectrum was prolifically cloned worldwide - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Extensive list of clones in USSR/Russia/Ukraine/Eastern Europe - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Resource: oldcrap.org has documentation on many clones - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Build quality often even cheaper than original ZX Spectrum - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]

### Documentation Challenges
- Schematics use Soviet designations for logic ICs - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Need cross-reference to Western TTL part numbers - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
- Language barrier for non-Russian speakers - Source: [3XApa-s1nhc]
