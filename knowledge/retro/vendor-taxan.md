## Platform-Specific Knowledge

### Taxan RGB Vision III

#### Overview
- 12-inch color CRT monitor from 1984 - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Made by Kaga Electronics in Japan - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Sold under Taxan brand in US, also rebadged as Acorn Computers monitor - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- High resolution with 0.38mm dot pitch (RGB Vision 3 highest res version) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Supports both TTL and analog RGB inputs - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]

#### Model Variants
- RGB Vision 1: 0.63mm dot pitch - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- RGB Vision 2: 0.47mm dot pitch - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- RGB Vision 3: 0.38mm dot pitch (highest resolution) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]

#### Input Modes
- Mode 1: PC mode (RGB + Intensity), uses DIN connector - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Mode 2: Apple II / NEC PC-8001 mode, analog RGB, uses multi-pin connector - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Mode 3: Apple III mode (xRGB), uses DIN connector - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]

#### Connector Compatibility
- Mode 1 DIN connector identical to Commodore 1084 RGBI input - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Existing 1084 RGBI cables work with this monitor - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]

#### TTL vs Analog RGB
- Mode 1 (PC): TTL RGB + Intensity (CGA compatible) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Mode 2 (Apple II): Analog RGB 1-2V peak-to-peak - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Mode 3 (Apple III): TTL xRGB (different color mapping than CGA) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Display supports 256+ colors in analog mode - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]

#### xRGB vs CGA
- Apple III uses xRGB which has different color mapping than CGA - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Connecting Apple III to CGA monitor produces wrong colors - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- RGB2HDMI can be configured for xRGB compatibility - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]

#### Internal Construction
- Isolated transformer-based power supply (not hot chassis) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Tripler or diode voltage multiplier for CRT high voltage - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Focus and screen voltage divider assembly - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- High-resolution CRT has larger neck diameter than standard CRTs - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]

#### Known Issues
- Width control may become non-functional (requires solder reflow on flyback) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- TTL to analog conversion board can oversaturate colors - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Brown color may not display correctly (shows same as dark red) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Dark gray color may not display at all - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Right side of screen may appear dimmer (capacitor aging) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]

#### Width Control Repair
- Variable inductor controls horizontal size - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- Use plastic adjustment tool (not metal) to avoid RF heating - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- If control has no effect, reflow solder joints around flyback transformer - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
- LCR meter can verify inductor functionality (68-315 microhenry range) - Source: [cK1OYT_asXc]
