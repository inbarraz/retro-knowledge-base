### Polystyrene (Styrofoam) Residue Removal from Cables

#### The Problem
- White residue appears on cables that were stored touching styrofoam packaging - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Chemical reaction between PVC cable jacket and polystyrene (styrofoam) - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Common on cables from computers/keyboards stored in original boxes - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Similar reaction can occur between PVC cables and ABS plastic cases - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- ABS plastic can show burn marks/indentation where cable rested on it - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]

#### Method 1: 99% IPA Only
- Safe for cable jacket - does not damage PVC - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Requires significant rubbing/abrasion to remove residue - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Use cotton swabs or paper towels with IPA - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- May need multiple passes and fingernail scraping - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Leaves cable shiny and undamaged - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Best for straight sections of cable - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]

#### Method 2: Acetone (Use Caution)
- Works much faster than IPA - dissolves styrofoam residue quickly - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- DANGER: Will instantly melt ABS plastic (computer cases, etc.) - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Keep acetone far away from computer cases while cleaning - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- May slightly dull/texture the cable surface - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Leaves behind sticky residue that requires follow-up cleaning - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Test first on inconspicuous area to check for damage - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- If cotton swab turns color of cable (black), acetone is damaging it - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]

#### Best Method: Acetone Then IPA
- Use acetone first to quickly dissolve bulk of styrofoam residue - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Acetone leaves sticky residue behind - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Follow with 99% IPA to remove sticky residue - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- IPA also removes dulled appearance from acetone - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Good for coiled cables where scrubbing each loop is tedious - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Finish with Windex/glass cleaner for final polish - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]

#### Testing Acetone Safety
- PVC cables generally safe with acetone (some dulling may occur) - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Acetone bottle itself is often made of compatible plastic - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- ABS plastic = instant melting with acetone - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]
- Commodore 64 cases, IBM PC cases = ABS, do not use acetone near them - Source: [VIvNWEg3naI]

## Mac Capacitor Leakage Cleanup

### Vinegar Treatment
- Vinegar helps neutralize cap leakage electrolyte - Source: [rpVAg6hG__Y]
- Apply generously to affected areas, will foam slightly where reacting - Source: [rpVAg6hG__Y]
- Scrub with toothbrush or anti-static brush to work into tight spaces - Source: [rpVAg6hG__Y]
- Flip board and treat both sides as electrolyte soaks through - Source: [rpVAg6hG__Y]
- Follow with warm soap and water wash - Source: [rpVAg6hG__Y]

### Post-Wash Salt Residue
- White crystalline "salts" form on IC legs after drying - Source: [rpVAg6hG__Y]
- Only appears in areas where cap leakage occurred - Source: [rpVAg6hG__Y]
- Remove with 99% IPA and cotton swab or brush - Source: [rpVAg6hG__Y]
