- Japanese character set option in DIP switches - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

#### Hardware Architecture
- Motorola 6802 CPU (includes 128 bytes internal RAM and clock oscillator) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Motorola 6845 CRTC (CRT controller) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Motorola 6821 PIA (peripheral interface adapter) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Static RAM chips for video buffer - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Multiple EPROMs: program code and character fonts - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- DIP switches for all configuration (baud rate, emulation mode, cursor style, etc.) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

#### Serial Ports
- Main port: RS-232 connection to host computer/mainframe - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Aux port: For connecting serial printer - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- RS-232 requires +/-12-15V, generated by internal power supply - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Half/full duplex switch on DIP settings - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

#### Power Supply
- Three voltage rails: +5V, +15V, -12V - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- +5V for logic board (measured 4.95V = perfect) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- +15V for CRT driver - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- -12V for RS-232 negative voltage - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Large mains transformer with linear regulators - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- CRT board runs independently (no direct PSU connection) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

#### CRT Driver Board
- Generic third-party CRT driver board (not Liberty-specific) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Similar boards found in TRS-80 Model 3, Model 4, many terminals - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Sticker date code: "8305" (5th week of 1983) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Slotted edge connector for motherboard connection - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Board is customizable for different scan frequencies - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

#### Vertical Deflection
- Uses NEC uPC1031H2 vertical deflection IC - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Integrated power amp stage (no separate push-pull transistors) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- V-sync input directly from motherboard - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- V-size pot and linearity pot connected to IC - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Output drives deflection yoke directly - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Yoke inductance spec: 2.7-4.15mH, 2-7 ohms resistance - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

#### Keyboard
- SMK brand key switches - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Same switch type as Apple IIe keyboard (but different stem length) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Apple IIe stems are taller than Freedom 100 stems - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Switches are disassemblable - can swap stems/plungers between keyboards - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Fixed cable with phone jack style connector - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Beep speaker located inside keyboard - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Broken switch stems common problem - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

#### Common Issues

##### Vertical Deflection Squish
- Symptom: Image severely squished vertically at top and bottom - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Image may wrap around (text appears upside down) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Size control may have delayed/weird effect - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Problem may be intermittent, fixing itself after warmup - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Suspect electrolytic capacitors reforming after long storage - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Can indicate bad uPC1031H2 IC or bad caps - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Test by running for 30+ minutes to see if caps reform - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

##### Sticky Anode Cap
- High voltage anode cap becomes extremely sticky with age - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Rubber/silicone degrades and turns to goo - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Sticky residue drips down CRT face - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- WD-40 works as solvent to clean sticky residue - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Follow WD-40 with Windex to remove oily residue - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Stickiness makes cap very difficult to remove - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]

#### Testing with Modern Equipment
- Use Raspberry Pi with USB-to-serial adapter - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Set terminal type to "dumb" for basic operation - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Freedom mode has cursor addressing and screen clear - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
- Half-duplex mode allows local echo (keyboard typed locally) - Source: [QqzmxYsK5xc]
