- Known for advanced 3D graphics capabilities - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Approximately 486-era technology - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Runs IRIX operating system - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]

#### Front Panel
- Removable front cover - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Bays for CD-ROM, tape drive - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Hot-swappable hard drive bay - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]

#### Memory
- Uses 72-pin SIMMs - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Specific memory requirements - not all 72-pin SIMMs work - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Machine may not POST with incompatible RAM - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- May require parity or specific memory type (EDO/fast page) - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]

#### Storage
- Uses SCSI hard drives - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Supports Ultra Wide SCSI (68-pin) with adapter - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- 50-pin to 68/80-pin adapter allows use of newer faster drives - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Hot-swap drive sleds - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]

#### Video Output
- Uses 13W3 video connector (proprietary SGI connector) - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Requires sync-on-green capable monitor - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- 13W3 to VGA adapters available - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]

### 13W3 Video Connector

#### Design
- Three coaxial conductors for RGB signals - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Additional pins for sync and signaling - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Originally designed because VGA wasn't proven for high-frequency signals - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]

#### Compatibility
- Used on SGI workstations - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Also used on Sun workstations - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- Sony Trinitron 21" monitors commonly had 13W3 connector - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]
- 13W3 to VGA adapters enable use with modern monitors - Source: [wBoC7SNLmQ0]

### Extreme Graphics Card
