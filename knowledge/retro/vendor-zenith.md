- Modified TV chassis design with transformer isolation - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Composite video input (not TTL) - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Used with early personal computers like Apple II, TRS-80 - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]

#### Design Philosophy (Modified TV)
- Based on consumer TV chassis with modifications - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Key difference from live chassis TVs: Has isolation transformer - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Transformer provides galvanic isolation between mains and electronics - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Much safer design than "hot chassis" TVs of the era - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]

#### Live Chassis vs Isolated Chassis Safety
- Live chassis TVs: One side of mains directly connected to chassis ground - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- If plugged in "wrong way": Chassis can be at mains potential (lethal) - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Isolated chassis: Transformer separates mains from electronics completely - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- ZVM-121 is isolated chassis (safe to touch chassis when plugged in) - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Always verify isolation before working on any CRT device - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]

#### Front Panel Controls

- Typical for consumer TV-derived monitors - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Vertical linearity may be poor near top/bottom edges - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]

#### Testing Horizontal Oscillator
- Use Spectroid app on phone to verify 15kHz horizontal frequency - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Place phone near monitor, app shows frequency spectrum - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- NTSC monitors should show peak at approximately 15.7kHz - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
- Works because horizontal oscillator produces audible whine - Source: [kVEmURyF87M]
