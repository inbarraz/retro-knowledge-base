### Hitachi VM-129U (12" Monochrome CCTV Monitor)

#### Overview
- 12-inch monochrome CRT security/CCTV monitor - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- 700 line resolution specification - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Perfect companion for Apple II era computers - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Originally designed for security camera systems - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Composite video input (BNC connectors) - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

#### Input Configuration
- 75 ohm termination switch on rear - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Set to 75 ohm (terminated) when monitor is last device in chain - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Set to Hi-Z (high impedance) when passing signal through to another monitor - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Incorrect termination causes bright/washed out or dim picture - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

#### Sub-Brightness Control
- Internal sub-brightness pot adjusts baseline black level - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Accessible through chassis (may need cover removal) - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Adjust if front brightness control has insufficient range - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Set sub-brightness for proper black level, use front for viewing preference - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

#### CRT Testing (with Sencore/B&K TR-850 or similar)

##### Setup
- Match tester socket to CRT base configuration - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Connect ground lead to CRT DAG coating - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Note CRT neck temperature before testing (cold vs warm) - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

##### Emissions Test
- Measures electron emission from cathode - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Good CRT: meter reads in green/good zone - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Weak CRT: meter reads in yellow/questionable zone - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Dead CRT: meter stays in red/bad zone - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Emissions may improve after CRT warms up - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

##### Life Test
- Predicts remaining useful life of CRT - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Measures emissions under stress conditions - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Good life test = years of service remaining - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Poor life test = may fail soon even if currently working - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

##### CRT Rejuvenation (Baking)
- Some testers can "bake" weak CRTs to restore emissions - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Heats cathode to burn off contamination - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- May temporarily restore weak tube - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Not a permanent fix - tube may degrade again - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Risk of making tube worse - use cautiously - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

#### CRT Swap Procedure

##### Finding Replacement CRT
- Match physical size (31cm / 12-inch diagonal) - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Check mounting tab positions on implosion band - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Tabs must align with chassis mounting points - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Can source CRTs from old TVs, other monitors - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

##### Phosphor Options
- P1 (green phosphor): Common in vintage computers, Apple II era - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- P4 (white phosphor): Common in TVs and later monitors - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Can swap different phosphor color for aesthetic preference - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Green P1 phosphor popular for authentic vintage look - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

##### Deflection Yoke Transfer
- Keep original yoke if inductance matches chassis design - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Measure yoke inductance with multimeter to compare - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- If inductance differs significantly, transfer yoke to new tube - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Loosen yoke clamp, slide off old tube - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Slide onto new tube, adjust position while powered - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

##### Yoke Positioning
- Affects image centering and geometry - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Too far back: Image too large, corners cut off - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Too far forward: Image too small, may not fill screen - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Tighten clamp only after image properly positioned - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]

#### Apple II Compatibility
- Composite video output from Apple II connects directly - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- High resolution (700 lines) shows sharp 80-column text - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Monochrome preferred for text applications - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
- Green phosphor matches Apple II aesthetic - Source: [IW_R8-Xmiic]
