## Platform-Specific Knowledge

### GE 12XB9102S Performance Television

#### Overview
- 12" black and white portable TV - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Chassis XB-F / XB12 - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- All solid state (transistorized) - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Date codes indicate ~1980 manufacture - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- CRT: GE 12VBJP4 - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Assembled in Singapore - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]

#### Controls
- Volume, brightness, contrast on front - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Vertical hold, vertical size on back - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Horizontal hold (oscillator) on back - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- VHF and UHF tuners with fine tuning - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]

#### Construction
- Single-sided PCB - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Fuse soldered standing up on board - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Point-to-point wiring in places - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Metal speaker grille/front plate - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Carry handle on top (slippery grip design) - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]

#### Live Chassis Design
- No isolation transformer - chassis at mains potential - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Polarized plug prevents reversing hot/neutral - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Wide blade = neutral, narrow blade = hot - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Safety check: <600K ohms from wide blade to exposed metal - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- "No user serviceable parts" label due to solid state design - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]

#### High Voltage
- No rubber cap on anode connection (common for era) - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- ~12kV high voltage (approx 1kV per inch of screen) - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Exposed anode contact dangerous with cover off - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]

#### Antenna System
- Separate VHF and UHF tuners internally - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Twin lead (unshielded) runs to tuner - picks up interference - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- External antenna screws on back panel - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Rod antenna for portable use - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]

#### Known Issues
- Tuner can get dirty/scratchy after storage - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Not very sensitive tuner (low-cost design) - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Interference susceptibility due to unshielded twin lead - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Picture quality was never exceptional (budget TV) - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]

#### Testing Notes
- Capacitors tested fine even after 40 years (NOS example) - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- CRT brightness excellent when unused - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- DE5000 LCR meter used for in-circuit cap testing - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- VG91 signal generator useful for testing RF-only TVs - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]

#### CRT Compatibility
- 12VBJP4 CRT potentially compatible with RCA TRS-80 Model 1 monitor - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
- Good candidate CRT donor for other monitors - Source: [sxmsR02TAl0]
