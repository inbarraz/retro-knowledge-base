## Platform-Specific Knowledge

### IQ-120 Terminal

#### Overview
- Computer terminal with built-in CRT display - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Dark textured color bezel with light grayish-beige edges - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Keyboard connects at front with cable that has enough length for service work - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

#### CRT Specifications
- Original CRT uses G2/screen voltage of 230-280V range - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Driver board has very fixed G2 voltage output with limited adjustability - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Board designed specifically for CRTs requiring lower G2 voltage - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Cannot use Amber CRTs that require 500-600V G2 voltage - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- P4 (white) phosphor CRTs from TV applications are compatible - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- 12-inch CRT size - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

#### CRT Mounting
- Four fasteners hold CRT in place - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Anode cap connection on left side (some replacement CRTs have it on top) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- CRT connector has keyed orientation - may need rotation for different CRTs - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Copper contacts on chassis ground the CRT (no separate ground wire needed) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

#### Internal Adjustments
- Focus control - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Screen control (overall intensity/black level) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Vertical linearity - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Vertical hold - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Vertical size - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Centering rings on deflection yoke for image position - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- External brightness and contrast controls - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

#### Known Issues

##### CRT "Cataracts"
- PVA glue between CRT face and safety glass can cloud over time - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Creates hazy/foggy appearance obscuring the display - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- PVA glue is potentially water-soluble - submerging front in water may dissolve it - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Alternative fix: Heat front of CRT to loosen glue, pry off safety glass - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- SAFETY: Heated PVA glue releases toxic fumes - do outside only - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- SAFETY: Risk of implosion - wear face shield, gloves, full body coverage - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

#### Disassembly
- Two screws on front, two on back, plus one above fan - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Top cover removes after screws - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Motherboard can flip away for CRT access when terminal is on its side - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

#### CRT Replacement Procedure
1. Remove top cover (screws at front, back, above fan) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
2. Loosen deflection yoke mounting band - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
3. Remove four CRT fasteners - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
4. Disconnect high voltage anode cap - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
5. Disconnect rear CRT connector - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
6. Slide out old CRT - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
7. Install new CRT with deflection yoke loosely placed - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
8. Connect rear connector (check key orientation) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
9. Connect anode cap - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
10. Power on and adjust deflection yoke position before tightening - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
11. Adjust centering rings for image position - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
12. Adjust focus and screen controls - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
13. For bezel gap: Terminal upside down, loosen CRT fasteners, slide CRT forward to meet bezel - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

## CRT Compatibility Notes

### G2/Screen Voltage Ranges
- Lower range (200-300V): Older TV-style P4 phosphor 12" CRTs - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Higher range (500-600V): Later computer CRTs, green and amber phosphors - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- When G2 voltage is too low for a CRT, you get NO image at all (not even faint) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- G2 voltage can be measured on back of CRT connector (carefully - up to 600V!) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

### Deflection Yoke Compatibility
- Measure inductance with multimeter to check compatibility - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Original Soroc yoke: 73.5 mH and 120 µH - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Incompatible yoke example: 4.4 mH and 1700 µH (from TV application) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- If yoke inductance doesn't match, keep original yoke and just swap the tube - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]

### Physical Compatibility
- Check mounting tab positions (should face toward back) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Check anode cap position (side vs top) - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Check rear connector pin orientation/keying - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
- Inspect replacement CRT for scratches on face - Source: [_uq86UDmbsU]
