### ZX Spectrum Comparison

#### Key Differences from Timex 2068
- Original ZX Spectrum uses Ferranti ULA (not NCR like 2068) - Source: [bkAACiczHWo]
- 48K RAM on ZX Spectrum uses rejected 64K chips (only half used) - Source: [bkAACiczHWo]
- Jumper on ZX Spectrum selects which half of 64K chip to use - Source: [bkAACiczHWo]
- ZX Spectrum RAM requires +12V, +5V, and -5V (4116 chips) - Source: [bkAACiczHWo]
- No built-in cartridge slot on ZX Spectrum - Source: [bkAACiczHWo]
- No built-in joystick ports on ZX Spectrum - Source: [bkAACiczHWo]

#### Restoration Resources
