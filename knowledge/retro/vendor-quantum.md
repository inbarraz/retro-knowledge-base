## Platform-Specific Knowledge

### Quantum Hardcard EZ Series

#### Overview
- 16-bit ISA hard card (different from 8-bit Plus Hardcards) - Source: [cXbDSudlSTQ]
- Designed for 286/386+ systems with 16-bit ISA slots - Source: [cXbDSudlSTQ]
- Quantum acquired Plus Corporation (original hard card maker) - Source: [cXbDSudlSTQ]
- More reliable than older Plus hard cards due to using standard IDE interface - Source: [cXbDSudlSTQ]
- Completely enclosed design (unlike older exposed hard cards) - Source: [cXbDSudlSTQ]

#### Hardcard EZ 85 Specifications
